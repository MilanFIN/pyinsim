# PYINSIM

NOTE: this is a port of pyinsim from python 2.7->3.8. Some functionality has been tested and verified to be functional, but everything hasn't yet been tested troughoutly. Use at your own caution for now. This readme will be updated when/if this build is confirmed to be stable and function correctly.


pyinsim is a InSim module for the Python programming language. It creates 
socket connection with LFS and provides many classes, functions and 
enumerations for sending and receiving data between your program and the game.

## REQUIREMENTS

python 3.8->

http://www.python.org/download/

## INSTALLATION

To install pyinsim on Windows, simply unzip the package and run the windows
installer 'pyinsim-x.x.x.win32.exe'. 

To install from the source distribution, unzip the package and run the command 
'python setup.py install'. 

Both of these methods will install pyinsim to your 
'X:\Path\To\Python\Lib\site-packages' directory. 

Of course you always have the option of just copying the package folder into 
your program's source directory (this is also useful for when you redistribute
your program.).
